<p><strong>DbUp is a .NET library that helps you to deploy changes to SQL Server databases</strong>. It tracks which SQL scripts have been run already, and runs the change scripts that are needed to get your database up to date.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Start by creating a simple C# console project in Visual Studio, and adding your SQL scripts to it. From the Properties window, mark them as Embedded Resources:</p>

<img src="images/add-scripts.png" alt="DbUp Sample" />

<p>Next, use NuGet to install the DbUp package:</p>

<pre><code>Install-Package DbUp</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in <code>Program.cs</code>, add the following code:</p>

<pre><code>static int Main(string[] args)
{
    var connectionString = 
        args.FirstOrDefault()
        ?? "Server=(local)\\SqlExpress; Database=MyApp; Trusted_connection=true";

    var upgrader =
        DeployChanges.To
            .SqlDatabase(connectionString)
            .WithScriptsEmbeddedInAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())
            .LogToConsole()
            .Build();

    var result = upgrader.PerformUpgrade();

    if (!result.Successful)
    {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
        Console.WriteLine(result.Error);
        Console.ResetColor();
#if DEBUG
        Console.ReadLine();
#endif                
        return -1;
    }

    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
    Console.WriteLine("Success!");
    Console.ResetColor();
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p>You now have a console application that can run change scripts against your database! After running it, you'll see something like this:</p>

<img src="images/first-run.png" alt="First run - the scripts get executed" />


<p>The next time you run it, you'll see:</p>

<img src="images/second-run.png" alt="Second run - the scripts have already been executed" />

<h2>Why a console application?</h2>
<p>
  By putting your migration scripts in an executable that can be run, you'll get a lot of benefits:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can hit F5 at any time to test the migration scripts</li>
  <li>Other developers on your team can do the same</li>
  <li>You can execute them as part of an automated deployment</li>
  <li>You can run it during your integration tests</li>
  <li>Since it's in your VS solution, it will go into source control along with the rest of your code</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, instead of a console application, you can create a class library that references DbUp, and embed it into a maintenance screen inside your application.</p>

<p>Check out this blog post to learn more about <a href="http://www.paulstovell.com/database-deployment">the philosophy behind DbUp</a>.</p>

<h2>Journaling</h2>
<p>
  By default, DbUp adds a table to your SQL Server database called SchemaVersions, which tracks the scripts that have already been executed. Before running, DbUp checks this table to work out which scripts should be skipped. After running, it inserts journal records to record the scripts that have been run.
</p>
<img src="images/schema-versions.png" alt="The SchemaVersions table created by DbUp" />
<p>
  You can change the name of this table using:
</p>
<pre><code>DeployChanges.To
    .SqlDatabase(connectionString)
    .WithScriptsEmbeddedInAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())
    .JournalToSqlTable("MySchema", "MyTable")
    .LogToConsole()
    .Build();
</code></pre>

<p>You can ask DbUp whether scripts need to be run, without actually running them, using:</p>
<pre><code>var upgrader =
    DeployChanges.To
        .SqlDatabase(connectionString)
        .WithScriptsEmbeddedInAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())
        .LogToConsole()
        .Build();

var isRequired = upgrader.IsUpgradeRequired();
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can implement your own <code>IJournal</code> to track the scripts yourself. Most parts of DbUp are exensible in this way; just browse the API to see what it can do.</p> 

<h2>Supported databases</h2>

<p>DbUp supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SQL Server 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012</li>
  <li>SQL Azure</li>
  <li>SQL CE 4.0</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you're interested in adding support for other databases we'd love to hear from you.

  DbUp began life as the database migration tool inside <a href="http://www.funnelweblog.org">FunnelWeb</a>, an open source ASP.NET MVC blog engine. Despite its humble origins, growing up, DbUp always thought it could aspire to something bigger. Now it is out in the world on its own, making its own way in life, the little script runner that could.
